## 📖 Overview

Skin diseases are common and can be identified through visual patterns. This project uses image classification techniques to detect common skin conditions using machine learning. It’s aimed at assisting dermatologists and users with early diagnosis.

---

## ✅ Features

- Upload skin images for analysis
- Predicts the type of skin disease
- Image preprocessing for better accuracy
- Trained using labeled dermatology image datasets
- User-friendly interface (web-based)

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **ML/DL Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Model Type**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Other Tools**: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib

---

## 📊 Model Details

- **Architecture**: Custom CNN / Pretrained (e.g., VGG16, ResNet)
- **Input Size**: 224x224 RGB images
- **Dataset Used**: [Specify if you used HAM10000, ISIC, or a custom dataset]

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads an image of a skin lesion.
2. The image is preprocessed (resized, normalized).
3. The model predicts the disease class.
4. Result is shown with the predicted disease name.
